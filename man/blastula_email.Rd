\arguments{
\item{content_width}{The width of the rendered HTML content. By default, this
is set to \verb{1000px}. Using widths less than \verb{600px} is generally not advised
but, if necessary, be sure to test such HTML emails with a wide range of
email clients before sending to the intended recipients. The Outlook mail
client (Windows, Desktop) does not respect \code{content_width}.}

\item{toc}{If you would like an automatically-generated table of contents in
the output email, choose \code{TRUE}. By default, this is \code{FALSE} where no table
of contents will be generated.}

\item{toc_depth}{The depth of headers to include in the table of contents (
should \code{toc} be set to \code{TRUE}).}

\item{toc_float}{An option to float the table of contents to the left of the
main document content. By default, this is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{number_sections}{Sections can be sequentially numbered if this is set
to \code{TRUE}. By default, this is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{section_divs}{This wraps sections in \verb{<section>} tags and attaches
identifiers to the enclosing \verb{<section>}s. This is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fig_width, fig_height}{The figure width and height in units of inches.}

\item{fig_retina}{The scaling factor for retina displays. The default value
is \code{2}, which is the preferred choice for most retina displays. This can be
set to \code{NULL} to prevent retina scaling. Note that this will always be
\code{NULL} if \code{keep_md} is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fig_caption}{An option to render figures with captions. By default,
this is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{dev}{The R graphics device for figures. By default, this is the \code{png}
device.}

\item{smart}{An option to produce typographically correct output. This will
convert straight quotes to curly quotes, \verb{---} to em dashes, \verb{--} to en
dashes, and instances of \code{...} to ellipses. By default, this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{self_contained}{Should a self-contained output file be generated. By
default, this is \code{TRUE}. The standalone HTML file will have no external
dependencies, it will use URIs to incorporate the contents of linked
scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos.}

\item{template}{The Pandoc template to use for rendering. This is the
\code{"blastula"} template by default.}

\item{includes}{A named list of additional content to include within the
document. This is typically created using the \code{\link[rmarkdown:includes]{rmarkdown::includes()}}
function. By default, this is set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{keep_md}{Should you need the keep the intermediate Markdown (.md) file,
set this to \code{TRUE}. By default, the .md file is not kept.}

\item{md_extensions}{Markdown extensions to be added or removed from the
default definition or R Markdown.}

\item{connect_footer}{Should a prepared footer message with links be included
in the rendered email?}

\item{...}{Specify other options in \code{\link[rmarkdown:html_document]{rmarkdown::html_document()}}.}
