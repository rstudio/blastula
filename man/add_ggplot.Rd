\title{Create an HTML fragment for an embedded ggplot image}
\usage{
add_ggplot(
  plot_object,
  width = 5,
  height = 5,
  alt = NULL,
  align = c("center", "left", "right", "inline"),
  float = c("none", "left", "right")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_object}{The \code{ggplot2} plot object.}

\item{width}{The width of the output plot in inches.}

\item{height}{The height of the output plot in inches.}

\item{alt}{Text description of image passed to the \code{alt} attribute inside of
the image (\verb{<img>}) tag for use when image loading is disabled and on
screen readers. Defaults to the \code{ggplot2} plot object's title, if exists.
Override by passing a custom character string or \code{""} for no text.}

\item{align}{The alignment to be used for the image. If not \code{"inline"}, the
image will appear in its own block, i.e. there will not be text to the left
or right of it.}

\item{float}{The float value to be used for the image. If not \code{"none"}, text
will flow around the image, and the \code{align} argument will be ignored.}
}
\value{

the plot image should appear.
