#' Add a file attachment to an email message
#'
#' This gives us a simple interface for attaching a file to the email object.
#' When it comes time to send the email through [smtp_send()], all attachments
#' (specified by individual calls to `add_attachment()`) will be faithfully
#' transmitted along with the message.
#'
#' There are options available to specify the attachment's MIME type, its
#' disposition, and customize the attachment's recipient-facing filename.
#'
#' @inheritParams smtp_send
#' @param file The filename for the file to be attached.
#' @param content_type The MIME type for the attachment. By default, this is
#'   guessed by the `mime::guess_type()` function on the basis of the `file`'s
#'   extension. The available MIME types that can be guessed are available in
#'   the `mime::mimemap` named character vector.
#' @param filename the filename for the attachment. This can be different than
#'   the basename provided to `file` for the purpose of customization. By
#'   default, the basename of `file` is taken to be the attachment's filename.
