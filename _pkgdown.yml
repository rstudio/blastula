  - title: Composing an Email Message
    desc: >
      An email message can be easily created with the `compose_email()`
      function. Want to attach files to the message? That's a cinch with
      `add_attachment()`. We can experiment with a example email message using
      `prepare_test_message()`.

    - add_attachment

    - blastula_template

  - title: Add Inline Components
    desc: >
      Several types of useful HTML fragments generated and incorporated into the
      email message content. We can create and use CTA buttons, links to images,
      and more!
    contents:
    - add_image
    - add_imgur_image
    - add_cta_button
    - add_ggplot
    - add_readable_time

  - title: HTML Blocks
    desc: >
      We can use HTML blocks to compose our email message. These functions are
      placed inside of an unnamed list and the order determines the ordering of
      the blocks. With these responsive, higher-level components, we can create
      sophisticated email messages with minimal effort.
    contents:
    - blocks
    - block_title
    - block_text
    - block_spacer
    - block_articles
    - block_social_links
    - article
    - social_link

  - title: Email Sending through SMTP
    desc: >
      Once the email looks good enough to send, we can send it through an SMTP
      server, with the MailGun service, or simply extract the HTML message body
      and go elsewhere. There is also the convenient option to create and store
      SMTP credentials with either the `create_smtp_creds_file()` or the
      `create_smtp_creds_key()` function.

  - title: Email Sending through RStudio Connect
    desc: >
      Using the RStudio Connect service, it's possible to publish R Markdown
      documents and provide a scheduled email based on the report. Example
      .Rmd documents can be generated by using the `prepare_rsc_example_files()`
      function. These files constitute a working example for a publishing
      workflow that uses the `render_connect_email()` and
      `attach_connect_email()` functions.

    - attach_connect_email
